# Hospital-Management
Application that manages and tracks patients
This is a small 'Hospital Management System', created to keep track of current patient logged into the waiting room. This aplication is intended to keep
patient capacity at a low due to COVID-19 restrictions. The application allows patients to login with first & last name with a random given identification 
number. Patients are logged into the system and placed in a waiting que based off of visiting reason. The receptionist has the option to create a log file of each person logged in for the day, as the program is able to write out to a File source. Patients can be removed from que as well as checking for sign up verification. 
This is a fun exercise that I plan to turn into a functional GUI application in the near future.
